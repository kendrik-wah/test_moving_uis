This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background of this project

During the circuit breaker, where I was grappling with Special Term and how my internship with IMDA got cancelled, I decided to try and improve my skills in React.
Here is my attempt to do this.

## What is in here

Various effects in other websites that caught my interest are replicated and implemented here, along with the use of various other peripherals like fonts that might improve the aesthetics of the user interface.

Also, I decided to try and learn how to use basic GitHub command line instructions! I figured that since I wanted to host this, I might as well learn Git as well.

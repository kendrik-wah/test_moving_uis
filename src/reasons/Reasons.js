      <h1 className="reasons-header">An experimental touch</h1>
      <p className="reasons-paragraph">I was first exposed to React in my internship with SESTO Robotics.</p>
      <p className="reasons-paragraph">After being exposed to User Interface development and the usage of front-end Web stacks to enable and integrate systems, I developed a budding (and growing) interest in developing and improving my ability to develop User Interfaces.</p>
      <p className="reasons-paragraph">However, after my internship stint, it was indeed difficult to find the time to develop these skills. As such, I looked aggressively for internships that could develop my skills in various ways, but to no avail.</p>
      <p className="reasons-paragraph">With the cancellation of my internship with IMDA, I was left with little option but to take up Special Term. In particular, I am currently taking EE4218 under Dr Rajesh Panicker, where I am learning in greater detail about FPGA technology and the intricacies of hardware programming.</p>
      <p className="reasons-paragraph">While the syllabus of this highly complex and difficult module is compressed into six weeks, I realized that while I am not attached to another internship company yet, I still have the room and opportunity to further hone my skills.</p>
      <p className="reasons-paragraph">As such, this is my way of further developing my skills in programming using the React Web Framework. In this UI/ webpage, you will find various effects that I have programmed out, with inspirations coming from various websites and natural phenomena.</p>
      <p className="reasons-paragraph">So, sit back, scroll down and enjoy the show.</p>
